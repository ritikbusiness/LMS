Absolutely! Since you're working closely with **Replit AI (Ghostwriter or Prompt-to-App)** and it’s already done some foundational setup (Google OAuth, PostgreSQL integration, storage replacement), here’s your **updated, highly structured and developer-friendly prompt** to give Replit next.

This prompt tells Replit **exactly what to build next**, with clear milestones and features — including **user onboarding**, **course CRUD**, **progress tracking**, **MCQs**, **certificates**, and **Razorpay integration**, **plus the ability to add full course roadmaps and documentation**.

## 🧠 🔧 **Updated Kayago LMS Prompt for Replit AI**

````
Continue building my full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) web app called **Kayago LMS**, hosted on Replit. The app is already set up with:

✅ Google OAuth using `passport-google-oauth20`  
✅ PostgreSQL database (replacing MemStorage)  
✅ Users stored in DB  
✅ Basic app structure running

Now, implement the following features one by one:

---

### ✅ 1. User Authentication Enhancements
- Expand the `users` table to include:
  - `id (UUID)`, `full_name`, `email`, `role (student | instructor | admin)`, `domain`, `created_at`
- After login via Google OAuth:
  - If user is new → redirect to an onboarding form
  - Form should capture:
    - Full Name (prefilled)
    - College Email (prefilled)
    - Year, Branch
    - Field of Interest (DevOps, MERN, AI, BDE, etc.)
- Save this data to the database

---

### 📚 2. Course Management System
Implement full CRUD for courses, modules, and lessons.

#### Tables:
```sql
courses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  domain TEXT,
  instructor_id UUID,
  price NUMERIC,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)

modules (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
  title TEXT,
  position INTEGER
)

lessons (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  module_id UUID REFERENCES modules(id),
  title TEXT,
  video_url TEXT,
  subtitle_url TEXT,
  downloadable_material TEXT,
  position INTEGER
)
````

✅ Add API routes for:

* `POST /courses`, `GET /courses`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
* Instructor dashboard to create/manage courses
* Student view to browse courses filtered by selected domain

---

### 📈 3. Lesson Progress Tracking

Allow students to track which lessons they’ve completed.

#### Table:

```sql
progress (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  lesson_id UUID,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

✅ Update progress when a lesson finishes
✅ Show green tick ✅ for completed lessons

---

### 🧪 4. MCQ Assessments (Per Module)

Add a basic quiz system with auto-grading.

#### Tables:

```sql
quizzes (
  id UUID,
  module_id UUID,
  question TEXT,
  options JSONB,
  correct_option INTEGER
)

quiz_results (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  quiz_id UUID,
  score INTEGER,
  attempted_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

✅ Show quiz after modules
✅ Grade and show score instantly

---

### 🎓 5. Certificate Generation

Generate downloadable certificates as PDFs.

#### Table:

```sql
certificates (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  course_id UUID,
  issue_date TIMESTAMP,
  cert_url TEXT
)
```

✅ Use `pdfkit` or `puppeteer` to generate
✅ Auto-issue when course is 100% completed
✅ View from student profile

---

### 💳 6. Razorpay Integration (Skip Stripe)

* Install `razorpay` SDK
* Setup `POST /api/payments/order` to generate orders
* Accept amount and currency
* On frontend, load Razorpay checkout popup
* On success:

  * Call backend to verify signature
  * Save payment info and auto-enroll student in course

---

### 📁 7. Course Roadmap + Docs Upload

When a new course is added:

* Allow instructor to define a **course roadmap** (visual/JSON or markdown)
* Upload **docs** and **starter code**
* Create an “Overview” tab in course UI with:

  * Course goals
  * Roadmap preview
  * Downloadable resources

---

### 💡 Bonus Suggestions for Future Prompts

* Add gamification (XP, badges, leaderboard)
* Add threaded Q\&A forum per course
* Add live session scheduling
* Add AI mentor assistant (GPT API)

---

✅ Focus on one feature at a time, reuse existing DB setup, and keep the API RESTful and modular.

This is part of **Kayago LMS** by AHRDSK, aimed at university students taking career-specific learning paths (like DevOps, AI, Cybersecurity, etc.).

```

---

### 📎 What To Do With This Prompt

Copy and paste it **directly into Replit AI** or the “Generate” tool. It is scoped cleanly, developer-friendly, and encourages modular work.

---

Let me know if you want:
- The **schema SQL file**
- The **backend API template for these routes**
- **UI wireframes** to help visualize how onboarding, course pages, or certificate downloads should look
