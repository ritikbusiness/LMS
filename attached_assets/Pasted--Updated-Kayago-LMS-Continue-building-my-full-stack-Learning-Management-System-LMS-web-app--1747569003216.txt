🧠 🔧 Updated Kayago LMS 
Continue building my full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) web app called **Kayago LMS**, hosted on Replit. The app is already set up with:

✅ Google OAuth using `passport-google-oauth20`  
✅ PostgreSQL database (replacing MemStorage)  
✅ Users stored in DB  
✅ Basic app structure running

Now, implement the following features one by one:

---

### ✅ 1. User Authentication Enhancements
- Expand the `users` table to include:
  - `id (UUID)`, `full_name`, `email`, `role (student | instructor | admin)`, `domain`, `created_at`
- After login via Google OAuth:
  - If user is new → redirect to an onboarding form
  - Form should capture:
    - Full Name (prefilled)
    - College Email (prefilled)
    - Year, Branch
    - Field of Interest (DevOps, MERN, AI, BDE, etc.)
- Save this data to the database

### 📚 2. Course Management System
Implement full CRUD for courses, modules, and lessons.

#### Tables:
```sql
courses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  domain TEXT,
  instructor_id UUID,
  price NUMERIC,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)

modules (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
  title TEXT,
  position INTEGER
)

lessons (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  module_id UUID REFERENCES modules(id),
  title TEXT,
  video_url TEXT,
  subtitle_url TEXT,
  downloadable_material TEXT,
  position INTEGER
)

✅ Add API routes for:
POST /courses, GET /courses, PUT, DELETE


Instructor dashboard to create/manage courses


Student view to browse courses filtered by selected domain



📈 3. Lesson Progress Tracking
Allow students to track which lessons they’ve completed.
Table:
progress (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  lesson_id UUID,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
)

✅ Update progress when a lesson finishes
 ✅ Show green tick ✅ for completed lessons

🧪 4. MCQ Assessments (Per Module)
Add a basic quiz system with auto-grading.
Tables:
quizzes (
  id UUID,
  module_id UUID,
  question TEXT,
  options JSONB,
  correct_option INTEGER
)

quiz_results (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  quiz_id UUID,
  score INTEGER,
  attempted_at TIMESTAMP
)

✅ Show quiz after modules
 ✅ Grade and show score instantly

🎓 5. Certificate Generation
Generate downloadable certificates as PDFs.
Table:
certificates (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  course_id UUID,
  issue_date TIMESTAMP,
  cert_url TEXT
)

✅ Use pdfkit or puppeteer to generate
 ✅ Auto-issue when course is 100% completed
 ✅ View from student profile

💳 6. Razorpay Integration (Skip Stripe)
Install razorpay SDK


Setup POST /api/payments/order to generate orders


Accept amount and currency


On frontend, load Razorpay checkout popup


On success:


Call backend to verify signature


Save payment info and auto-enroll student in course



📁 7. Course Roadmap + Docs Upload
When a new course is added:
Allow instructor to define a course roadmap (visual/JSON or markdown)


Upload docs and starter code


Create an “Overview” tab in course UI with:


Course goals


Roadmap preview


Downloadable resources




Add gamification (XP, badges, leaderboard)


Add threaded Q&A forum per course


Add live session scheduling


Add AI mentor assistant (GPT API)



✅ Focus on one feature at a time, reuse existing DB setup, and keep the API RESTful and modular.
This is part of Kayago LMS by AHRDSK, aimed at university students taking career-specific learning paths (like DevOps, AI, Cybersecurity, etc.).
