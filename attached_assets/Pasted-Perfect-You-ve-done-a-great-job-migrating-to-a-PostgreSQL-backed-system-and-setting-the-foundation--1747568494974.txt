Perfect! You’ve done a great job migrating to a PostgreSQL-backed system and setting the foundation for Kayago LMS. Now let’s move forward with your next goals while **keeping Razorpay** (not Stripe) in mind for payments.

---

## ✅ Recap of What’s Done:

* ✅ Set up **Google OAuth (passport-google-oauth20)**
* ✅ Connected to **PostgreSQL** successfully
* ✅ Replaced memory storage with **database storage** in `storage.ts`
* ✅ Application is **running smoothly**

---

## 🔄 Next Steps (Recommended Order):

### ✅ 1. **User Authentication Enhancements**

You're already using Google OAuth — now:

* [ ] Add role-based access (student, instructor, admin)
* [ ] Store user info in `users` table with fields:

  ```sql
  id (UUID), full_name, email, role, domain, created_at
  ```
* [ ] During onboarding (first login), redirect to a form to select:

  * Year, Branch, Field of Interest (e.g., DevOps, MERN)

---

### 🔧 2. **Course Management System**

Start building `Course`, `Module`, and `Lesson` models:

#### 📁 Suggested Schema:

```sql
courses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  domain TEXT,
  instructor_id UUID,
  price NUMERIC,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
)

modules (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  course_id UUID REFERENCES courses(id),
  title TEXT,
  position INTEGER
)

lessons (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  module_id UUID REFERENCES modules(id),
  title TEXT,
  video_url TEXT,
  subtitle_url TEXT,
  downloadable_material TEXT,
  position INTEGER
)
```

* [ ] Add UI for instructors to create courses
* [ ] Add UI for students to browse by field (e.g., AI, DevOps)

---

### 🧠 3. **Progress Tracking**

Track which lessons a student has completed:

#### Table:

```sql
progress (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  lesson_id UUID,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

Frontend:

* [ ] Show a green tick ✅ next to completed lessons
* [ ] Auto-update progress when a video finishes

---

### 📄 4. **Assessment System**

* [ ] Start with **MCQ quizzes** at the module level
* [ ] Build the schema:

```sql
quizzes (
  id UUID,
  module_id UUID,
  question TEXT,
  options JSONB,
  correct_option INTEGER
)
```

* [ ] Auto-grade and store results in `quiz_results`

---

### 🎓 5. **Certificate Generation**

Generate downloadable certificates on course completion:

* [ ] Use a tool like `pdfkit` or `puppeteer` (HTML to PDF)
* [ ] Store certificate metadata in:

```sql
certificates (
  id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  course_id UUID,
  issue_date TIMESTAMP,
  cert_url TEXT
)
```

## 💳 Razorpay Integration (Not Stripe)

You mentioned using **Razorpay**, so here’s how to do it:

### 🔧 Setup

1. Create a Razorpay account and get your **Key ID** and **Secret**

2. Install:

   ```bash
   npm install razorpay
   ```

3. In your backend:

```ts
// server/routes/payments.ts

import Razorpay from 'razorpay';

const razorpay = new Razorpay({
  key_id: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_ID!,
  key_secret: process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET!
});

app.post('/api/payments/order', async (req, res) => {
  const { amount, currency = 'INR' } = req.body;
  const options = {
    amount: amount * 100, // amount in paise
    currency,
    receipt: 'receipt_' + Date.now(),
  };
  const order = await razorpay.orders.create(options);
  res.json(order);
});
```

### 🧾 In Frontend:

* Load Razorpay checkout script
* Collect payment
* On success, call `/api/payments/verify`
* Then enroll the user in the course (update DB)

Let me know and I’ll give you:

* [ ] Full **Razorpay backend & frontend code**
* [ ] Frontend payment button + checkout example

## 🔜 What You Should Work On Next

Let’s keep things incremental:

| Feature              | Priority  | Why                         |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| User Onboarding      | 🔥 High   | Needed for course targeting |
| Course CRUD          | 🔥 High   | Core learning content       |
| Razorpay Checkout    | 🔥 High   | For monetization            |
| Lesson Progress      | 🔶 Medium | Increases student retention |
| MCQ Quizzes          | 🔶 Medium | Adds interactivity          |
| Forum / Gamification | 🟡 Later  | Boosts engagement           |

---

Would you like me to:

* Scaffold the full Razorpay integration code?
* Create the onboarding form route?
* Generate Sequelize or Prisma models for the DB?

Just tell me the feature to focus on, and I’ll guide or build it with you step by step. 💪
