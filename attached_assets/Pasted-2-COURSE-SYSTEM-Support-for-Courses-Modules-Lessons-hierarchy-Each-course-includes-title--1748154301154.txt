Track attempts in:

ts
Copy
Edit
quiz_results: id, quiz_id, user_id, selected_option, is_correct, timestamp
4. 💳 RAZORPAY PAYMENT SYSTEM
Create Razorpay orders via /api/payments/order

On payment success, enroll student and store:

ts
Copy
Edit
payments: id, user_id, course_id, amount, payment_id, status
Include API for purchase history

5. 🎓 AUTO-GENERATED CERTIFICATES

ts
Copy
Edit
certificates: id, user_id, course_id, issue_date, cert_url
6. 🧠 GAMIFICATION SYSTEM
XP & badge system:

ts
Copy
Edit
xp: id, user_id, type (lesson_complete | quiz_pass | forum_post), points, timestamp
Leaderboard API: Weekly & Monthly top learners

7. 🗣️ Q&A FORUM SYSTEM
Allow students to post questions per course/module

ts
Copy
Edit
posts: id, course_id, user_id, title, body, votes
replies: id, post_id, user_id, body, created_at
8. 🛡️ ADMIN DASHBOARD BACKEND
Role-based access control middleware

Admin APIs to:

Approve/reject courses

Suspend/promote users

View stats: total students, earnings, top courses

Export reports

Moderate flagged content

📦 BACKEND STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

RESTful API using express.Router

File/folder modular architecture:

bash
Copy
Edit
/routes
  /auth
  /courses
  /modules
  /lessons
  /quizzes
  /payments
  /forum
  /admin
/controllers
/middlewares
/models (Prisma schema)
/utils
Use .env for secrets (OAuth, Razorpay)

Add input validation (Joi or Zod)

Use secure practices: Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting

🧪 TESTING & DELIVERY:
✅ Test every endpoint with mock data
✅ Ensure authentication works with role restrictions
✅ Confirm Razorpay flow fully completes and stores enrollments
✅ Return JSON responses with clear messages and HTTP status codes
✅ Provide a README.md with setup instructions and API documentation

🚀 SCALE & MAINTAINABILITY:

Optimize for 10,000+ users

Use proper indexes in PostgreSQL

Ensure Prisma models have relations, constraints, and cascading delete where appropriate

🌈 BONUS IF POSSIBLE:

Add Swagger or Postman Collection export

Add test coverage with Jest or similar

Generate dummy seed data for testing (10+ courses, 5+ instructors, 30+ users)

👉 Now go ahead and build this full backend system with modular folders, working endpoints, and production-quality code. Make sure it works 100% and is ready to integrate with a frontend (React/Next.js).
